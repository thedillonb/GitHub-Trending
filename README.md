# GitHub-Trending

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/Dizzydaizys/GitHub-Trending.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Scrapes GitHub's trending and showcase pages to produce an API that can be consumed by downstream applications.
This application was originally designed for use in the iOS GitHub application [CodeHub](https://github.com/thedillonb/CodeHub)
but I welcome anyone else who wishes to expand upon this to do so.

## Demo

The following links are for demonstration purposes only. Please do **not** use these endpoints in your applications.
This instance is specifically designed for use by the iOS application, CodeHub, and is not ment for external use outside
of that application. The code is provided so that *YOU* may stand up your own instance.

## Installation

git clone git@github.com:thedillonb/GitHub-Trending.git

You will need to generate a GitHub token if you want to scrape the pages
